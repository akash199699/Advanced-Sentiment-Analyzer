# 💬 Advanced Sentiment Analyzer

An advanced sentiment analysis tool built using Python, providing accurate sentiment classification for text data. This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning to classify text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

---

## 🎯 Project Highlights

✅ Classifies text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral  
✅ Uses machine learning models for sentiment prediction  
✅ Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and tokenizing text  
✅ Easy-to-use command-line, notebook, or **Google Colab** interface
